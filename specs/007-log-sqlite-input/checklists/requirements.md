# Specification Quality Checklist: Logging System Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✓
- Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of specific logging libraries, file system APIs, etc.)
- Focused on operator and developer needs (monitoring, debugging, troubleshooting)
- Written in business language: "operators monitoring", "developers troubleshooting", "audit past activity"
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✓
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 12 functional requirements are testable:
  - FR-001: Testable by setting env var and observing log output
  - FR-002/003: Testable by comparing stdout with/without DEBUG mode
  - FR-004: Testable by monitoring stdout during request processing
  - FR-005-007: Testable by inspecting log files and filenames
  - FR-008-012: Testable through specific scenarios (startup, edge cases)
- Success criteria are measurable:
  - SC-001: "4-6 key steps per request" - countable
  - SC-005: "within 30 seconds" - measurable time
  - SC-006: "under 2 minutes" - measurable time
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of log libraries, file APIs)
- Acceptance scenarios are detailed for all 3 user stories (11 total scenarios)
- Edge cases identified: disk full, log rotation, missing workspace context, concurrent writes, invalid config, startup logs
- Scope clearly bounded: enhancing existing logger, log levels, file output, workspace identification
- Assumptions documented: 10 specific assumptions about implementation context

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✓
- Acceptance criteria defined through Given-When-Then scenarios for each user story
- User scenarios cover complete flow:
  - P1: Console output cleanup (operator monitoring)
  - P2: Debug mode (developer troubleshooting)
  - P1: Persistent logs with workspace context (audit/troubleshooting)
- Each scenario is independently testable and deliverable as MVP
- No implementation leakage detected (spec remains focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`. All requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous. No clarifications needed from the user.

## Notes

- The spec assumes the existing custom logger will be enhanced rather than replaced with a third-party library (documented in Assumptions)
- Log rotation strategy details (daily vs size-based) are left as reasonable defaults for implementation planning
- Workspace identifier extraction mechanism is documented but implementation approach is flexible
- All edge cases have been identified but specific error handling strategies are appropriately deferred to planning phase

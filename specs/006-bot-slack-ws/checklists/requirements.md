# Specification Quality Checklist: 006-bot-slack-ws

**Feature**: 複数Slackワークスペース対応
**Validated**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Planning

## Completeness Checks

### User Scenarios & Testing
- ✅ User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, etc.)
- ✅ Each story includes "Why this priority" explanation
- ✅ Each story includes "Independent Test" description
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases are documented
- ✅ All user stories are independently testable

**Notes**: 3 user stories prioritized (2 P1, 1 P2). All stories have clear business value explanations, independent test descriptions, and proper Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios. 5 edge cases documented with resolution strategies.

### Requirements
- ✅ Functional requirements are numbered (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- ✅ Requirements use "MUST" language appropriately
- ✅ Requirements are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- ✅ Key entities are identified (if data-related feature)
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

**Notes**: 10 functional requirements clearly numbered and defined using "しなければならない" (must) language. Key entities identified: Workspace, Request, Media. **FR-008 clarified**: Manual migration strategy selected - system will require manual migration to config file and error if both env vars and config file exist.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable
- ✅ Criteria are technology-agnostic
- ✅ Criteria focus on user outcomes
- ✅ Quantitative metrics provided (percentages, counts, etc.)

**Notes**: 6 success criteria with quantitative metrics (SC-001: minimum 3 workspaces, SC-002: 100% correct routing, SC-003: 100% isolation, SC-004: 100% workspace_id recording, SC-005: zero code changes for new workspace, SC-006: zero data loss on migration).

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- ✅ External dependencies documented
- ✅ Assumptions are explicit
- ✅ Integration points identified

**Notes**:
- Dependencies: Existing SlackBot implementation, DatabaseService, SimpleQueue, SQLite schema change
- Assumptions: Shared NotebookLM account, shared R2 bucket, file-based config, max ~10 workspaces, bot restart for config changes
- Integration: Database migration required for workspace_id column

## Quality Assessment

### Clarity
- ✅ Spec is written in clear, unambiguous language
- ✅ Requirements can be understood by non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ No contradictory requirements found

### Testability
- ✅ All requirements have corresponding acceptance criteria
- ✅ Success criteria are objectively verifiable
- ✅ Edge cases can be tested independently

### Scope
- ✅ Feature scope is well-defined
- ✅ Out-of-scope items are clear (no scope creep indicators)
- ✅ Feature can be implemented incrementally

**Notes**: Feature has clear boundaries: multi-workspace connection management, request routing, and workspace-specific data tracking. Out-of-scope: hot reload, management UI, database-based config.

## Validation Results

### Critical Issues
**None found** ✅

### Warnings
1. ⚠️ **One NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker** in FR-008: Migration strategy for existing single-workspace environment needs user decision

### Recommendations
1. **Database Migration**: Plan workspace_id column addition to requests table (nullable for backward compatibility)
2. **Configuration Format**: Design workspace config file structure (JSON/YAML) before implementation
3. **Error Recovery**: Document behavior when workspace connection fails mid-processing (already specified in edge cases)
4. **Testing Strategy**: Plan multi-workspace test environment setup (requires multiple Slack Bot installations)

## Clarification Resolved

| Requirement | Question | Decision |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| FR-008 | 既存の単一ワークスペース環境（現在の`BOT_TOKEN`、`APP_TOKEN`環境変数）をどのように扱うか？ | **Option B selected**: 手動で設定ファイルに移行することを要求する |

**Rationale**: User prefers manual migration approach. System will error if both environment variables and config file exist, ensuring explicit migration.

## Ready for Next Phase?

✅ **YES** - Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`

**After Clarification**: Once FR-008 is resolved, spec will be ready for `/speckit.plan`

**Rationale**:
- All mandatory sections complete
- Only 1 clarification needed (within 3-marker limit)
- Requirements are testable and measurable
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- User stories provide clear implementation path
- Success criteria enable objective validation

## Summary

This specification demonstrates high quality with:
- **3 prioritized user stories** (2 P1, 1 P2) with clear business value
- **10 functional requirements** with minimal ambiguity
- **6 measurable success criteria** (100% quantified)
- **5 edge cases** documented with resolution strategies
- **1 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker** - within acceptable limit

The feature is well-scoped and independently testable. After resolving FR-008 clarification, it will be ready for implementation planning.

# Tasks: Cross-Platform Support and Multi-Bot Handling

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-1-windows-mac/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (âœ…), spec.md (âœ…)

**Tests**: No automated tests requested in the feature specification. Manual E2E testing will be performed.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1 = Windows Support, US2 = Multi-Bot Handling)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` at repository root
- All paths are relative to repository root: `/Users/hirose30/Dropbox/dev/private/notebooklm-sumary-maker-slack-bot/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Branch setup and baseline verification

- [X] T001 Create and checkout branch `004-1-windows-mac` from main
- [X] T002 [P] Verify current codebase builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [X] T003 [P] Verify current test suite passes with `npm test` (if tests exist)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: No foundational blocking tasks for this feature

**Rationale**: Both user stories work with the existing codebase. No new core infrastructure is required before starting either story.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Windows Environment Support (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

  - Keep backward compatibility for single bot (if only one token provided)
- [ ] T024 [US2] Update event handlers in src/services/slack-bot.ts to pass bot_id to queue
  - Modify `app_mention` event handler to capture bot_id
  - Pass bot_id to `addJob()` method
- [ ] T025 [US2] Implement `postToBot(botId, channel, threadTs, message)` method in SlackBotManager
  - Retrieve correct App instance by bot_id
  - Post message using that bot's client

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - but has no tasks (no blocking prerequisites)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Windows)**: Can start after Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Multi-Bot)**: Can start after Phase 1 completion
  - **US1 and US2 can proceed in parallel** (different files, independent features)
- **Phase 5 (Polish)**: Depends on completion of US1 and US2

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Windows Support)**: Independent - can start after Phase 1
- **US2 (Multi-Bot Handling)**: Independent - can start after Phase 1

2. Complete US1: Windows Support (T004-T016) - **Priority P1** ðŸŽ¯
3. Validate US1 independently on Windows
4. Complete US2: Multi-Bot Handling (T017-T038) - **Priority P2**
5. Validate US2 independently with multiple bots
6. Complete Phase 5: Polish (T039-T043)

#### Option 2: Parallel Execution (Two Developers)

1. Both: Complete Phase 1 together (T001-T003)
2. Split work:
   - **Developer A**: US1 (T004-T016)
   - **Developer B**: US2 (T017-T038)
3. Both: Complete Phase 5 together (T039-T043)

#### Option 3: MVP First (Windows Only) ðŸŽ¯

1. Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. US1 only: Windows Support (T004-T016)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test on Windows environment
4. Deploy/demo Windows support
5. Later: Add US2 Multi-Bot (T017-T038) as incremental enhancement

## Notes

- US1 and US2 are **fully independent** - can be implemented in any order or in parallel
- Each user story has clear checkpoints for independent validation
- Existing functionality must remain unchanged (backward compatibility)
- All [P] tasks within a phase can be executed simultaneously for faster completion
- Database migration (T017-T019) must complete before queue changes (T026-T031)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate the feature independently before proceeding

**Estimated Total Effort**:
- US1 (Windows Support): 1-2 days
- US2 (Multi-Bot Handling): 2-3 days
- Combined: 3-5 days

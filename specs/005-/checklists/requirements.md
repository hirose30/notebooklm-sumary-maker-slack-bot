# Specification Quality Checklist: 005-

**Feature**: Slack メッセージクリーンアップと通知改善
**Validated**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Planning

## Completeness Checks

### User Scenarios & Testing
- ✅ User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, etc.)
- ✅ Each story includes "Why this priority" explanation
- ✅ Each story includes "Independent Test" description
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases are documented
- ✅ All user stories are independently testable

**Notes**: Both user stories are Priority P1 with clear business value. User Story 1 (clean conversation history) and User Story 2 (mandatory channel broadcast) are both independently testable and provide immediate user value.

### Requirements
- ✅ Functional requirements are numbered (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- ✅ Requirements use "MUST" language appropriately
- ✅ Requirements are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- ✅ Key entities are identified (if data-related feature)
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

**Notes**: 7 functional requirements clearly defined. Requirements specify WHAT the system must do (delete messages, use reply_broadcast) without specifying HOW (implementation details). Key entity "リクエスト" identified with ack_message_ts attribute.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable
- ✅ Criteria are technology-agnostic
- ✅ Criteria focus on user outcomes
- ✅ Quantitative metrics provided (percentages, counts, etc.)

**Notes**: 4 success criteria with 100% measurability (SC-001: 100% deletion rate, SC-002: 100% broadcast rate, SC-003: zero user impact from failures, SC-004: qualitative user experience improvement).

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- ✅ External dependencies documented
- ✅ Assumptions are explicit
- ✅ Integration points identified

**Notes**:
- Dependencies: Slack Bot, Request Queue, SQLite database schema change
- Assumptions: Slack API permissions (chat:write, chat.delete), reply_broadcast availability
- Integration: Requires database migration to add ack_message_ts column

## Quality Assessment

### Clarity
- ✅ Spec is written in clear, unambiguous language
- ✅ Requirements can be understood by non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ No contradictory requirements found

### Testability
- ✅ All requirements have corresponding acceptance criteria
- ✅ Success criteria are objectively verifiable
- ✅ Edge cases can be tested independently

### Scope
- ✅ Feature scope is well-defined
- ✅ Out-of-scope items are clear (no scope creep indicators)
- ✅ Feature can be implemented incrementally

**Notes**: Feature has clear boundaries: message cleanup + mandatory broadcast. No optional flags or configuration complexity.

## Validation Results

### Critical Issues
**None found** ✅

### Warnings
**None** ✅

### Recommendations
1. **Database Migration**: Ensure migration script adds `ack_message_ts` column to `requests` table before deployment
2. **Error Handling**: Consider logging strategy for chat.delete failures (already specified in FR-006)
3. **Testing Strategy**: Manual Slack testing required (no automated test infrastructure for Slack interactions)

## Ready for Next Phase?

✅ **YES** - Spec is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)

**Rationale**:
- All mandatory sections complete
- No clarifications needed
- Requirements are testable and measurable
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- User stories provide clear implementation path
- Success criteria enable objective validation

## Summary

This specification demonstrates high quality with:
- **2 prioritized user stories** (both P1) with clear business value
- **7 functional requirements** with no ambiguity
- **4 measurable success criteria** (100% quantified)
- **3 edge cases** documented with resolution strategies
- **Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers** - spec is complete

The feature is well-scoped, independently testable, and ready for implementation planning.
